Final Project: Milestone #1

# Kangaroo
## Overview
 As a student or researcher, there are often endless websites, papers ,links to return to. 
 Using only the Bookmarks bar as a resource to hold all this information can be confusing and
 can make these links easy to loose track of. Kangaroo provides a solution! 

 Kangaroo provides: 
 ⋅⋅* A secure platform (username/password) 
 ..* A place to organize and sort "bookmarks" by topic, priority, or date
 ..* For each bookmark, a space to write notes, reminders, or share the bookmark on a Forum for other   students 
 ..* Forum sorted by topic and university (if indicated by user)
